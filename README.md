# CollageFab

A Material UI floating action button that behaves like a collapsed stack of overlapping circles. Collapsed, a set of `Fab`s sits perfectly stacked and reads as a single button with soft gradient slices at the edges. On hover (mouse) or tap (touch), the parent expands its main-axis extent and the buttons fan out into a row while their CSS masks slide in lockstep with the movement — so the unfold reads as one continuous morph instead of a pop.

The trick is that each child is a full circle clipped by a static linear-gradient mask. As the element translates along the main axis, the `mask-position` is translated back by the same amount, keeping the fade boundary fixed in container space. Because the fade is a gradient rather than a hard clip, the parent's `filter: drop-shadow(...)` traces the soft edges cleanly.

## Requirements

- Node.js 18 or newer.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Routes

Routing is hash-based, so the built site works on any static host without a
server-side fallback.

| URL | Page |
| --- | --- |
| `/` | Demo — the component across button counts and directions. |
| `#/docs` | Components API reference for `CollageFab`. |
| anything else | Redirects to `#/`. |

## Deployment

The demo and docs are published to GitHub Pages:

1. Demo — <https://tiriana.github.io/collagefab/>
2. Components API — <https://tiriana.github.io/collagefab/#/docs>

`.github/workflows/deploy.yml` builds the project and publishes `dist/` on every
push to `main`. The production build uses a `/collagefab/` asset base while the
dev server stays at the root, so the local URL is unchanged — see
`vite.config.ts`.

## Scripts

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Start the Vite dev server with HMR. |
| `npm run build` | Type-check with `tsc --noEmit`, then build to `dist/`. |
| `npm run preview` | Serve the production build locally. |

## Usage

```tsx
import { Fab } from '@mui/material';
import { Settings, BugReport, Speed } from '@mui/icons-material';
import { CollageFab } from './components/CollageFab';

<CollageFab
  direction="left"
  trigger="hover"
  gap={14}
  fadeWidth={12}
  aria-label="Tools"
  slotProps={{
    item: (ownerState) =>
      ownerState.isAnchor ? { sx: { outline: '2px solid white' } } : {},
  }}
>
  {/* Index 0 is the anchor: it never moves and is never clipped. */}
  <Fab color="primary"><Settings /></Fab>
  <Fab color="secondary"><BugReport /></Fab>
  <Fab color="success"><Speed /></Fab>
</CollageFab>
```

Controlled usage, when the open state has to live in your own state:

```tsx
const [open, setOpen] = useState(false);

<CollageFab
  trigger="manual"
  open={open}
  onOpen={() => setOpen(true)}
  onClose={() => setOpen(false)}
>
  {/* children */}
</CollageFab>
```

## Props

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `children` | `React.ReactNode` | — | The buttons to stack. Order matters: index 0 is the anchor. |
| `direction` | `'left' \| 'right' \| 'up' \| 'down'` | `'left'` | Which way the row fans out from the anchor. `'left'` pins the stack to the right edge and expands leftward. |
| `size` | `'small' \| 'medium' \| 'large' \| number` | `'large'` | Diameter of each button. `small` 40, `medium` 48, `large` 56; numbers are used verbatim. |
| `gap` | `number` | `16` | Main-axis gap in pixels between buttons when expanded. |
| `fadeWidth` | `number` | `12` | Width in pixels of the soft gradient ramp at each slice edge. `0` gives a hard cut. |
| `trigger` | `'hover' \| 'click' \| 'manual'` | `'hover'` | `'hover'` opens on mouse enter, closes on leave, toggles on touch/pen tap. `'click'` toggles on any click. `'manual'` disables built-in pointer interaction. |
| `open` | `boolean` | — | Controlled open state. Passing it makes the component controlled. |
| `defaultOpen` | `boolean` | `false` | Initial state when uncontrolled. |
| `onOpen` | `(event) => void` | — | Fired on the closed → open transition. |
| `onClose` | `(event) => void` | — | Fired on the open → closed transition. |
| `disableClickAway` | `boolean` | `false` | If `true`, an outside press does not close the group. |
| `transitionDuration` | `number` | `400` | Duration of the morph in milliseconds. |
| `transitionEasing` | `string` | `'cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)'` | Easing of the morph. |
| `sx` | `SxProps<Theme>` | — | System overrides for the root. |
| `classes` | `Partial<CollageFabClasses>` | — | Override the `root` / `item` / `expanded` / `collapsed` classes. |
| `slots` | `Partial<CollageFabSlots>` | — | Replace the `root` or `item` slot component. |
| `slotProps` | `CollageFabSlotProps` | — | Props for each slot, or a callback `(ownerState) => props`. |

Remaining `div` attributes, including `aria-label` and `aria-labelledby`, are spread onto the root.

## Slots

1. `root` — the animated container. Owns the anchor-edge alignment, the animated main-axis extent, and the single `drop-shadow` filter. A replacement must forward `ref`, because the `ClickAwayListener` needs it.
2. `item` — one masked circular wrapper per child. `slotProps.item` accepts a props object or a callback `(ownerState) => props`, which is the per-child escape hatch: switch on `ownerState.index` or `ownerState.isAnchor` to style an individual button.

## ownerState

`CollageFabOwnerState` carries `open`, `direction`, `trigger`, `size` (resolved pixels), `gap`, `fadeWidth`, `count`, `transitionDuration` and `transitionEasing`. `CollageFabItemOwnerState` adds `index` and `isAnchor`.

Theme-level defaults and overrides work through the `MuiCollageFab` component key:

```tsx
const theme = createTheme({
  components: {
    MuiCollageFab: {
      defaultProps: { gap: 10 },
      styleOverrides: { item: { borderRadius: '8px' } },
    },
  },
});
```

## Notes

1. **The parent must pin the anchor edge.** The root animates its own main-axis extent, so it only fans out if its parent keeps the anchor edge fixed: `justify-content: flex-end` for `direction="left"`, `flex-start` for `"right"`, `align-items: flex-end` for `"up"`, `flex-start` for `"down"`. Otherwise the root grows in place and pushes surrounding content instead of fanning out.
2. **Each child is forced to `box-shadow: none` and 100% size**, so the parent owns the global shadow shape. Pass visual styles via each child's `sx`; the component overrides sizing and shadow only. Overriding that reset requires `slotProps.item.sx['& > *']` with `!important`.
3. **The single `drop-shadow` lives on the root**, because a filter traces the soft mask edges while a `box-shadow` would trace the wrapper rectangles. Setting `overflow: hidden` on the root via `sx` clips the fan-out.
4. **Collapsed slices are hidden from assistive technology.** While collapsed, the item wrappers are `aria-hidden` and made non-focusable, so they leave the tab order and the accessibility tree. The root stays focusable: Enter or Space opens the group, focus moves to the first item, and Escape closes it and returns focus to the root.
5. **With a single child no mask is applied** — it behaves like a plain `Fab`.
6. **`direction` is physical, not logical.** It is not mirrored under RTL; right-to-left layouts should set `direction="left"` explicitly.
